# Task 2 – Operating System Security Fundamentals (Windows)

## Objective
To understand operating system–level security concepts and implement basic OS hardening techniques using Windows security features.

## Tools Used

- Verified Windows Defender and Firewall status
- Identified running processes and services
- Learned why disabling unnecessary services reduces attack surface
- Documented OS hardening best practices

## Key Concepts Learned
- OS Hardening
- Least Privilege Principle
- File Permissions
- Attack Surface Reduction
- User Privilege Management

## Screenshots Included
- User account type
- Windows Firewall enabled
- Windows Defender protection
- Running processes
- Services list

## Outcome
This task improved my understanding of how operating systems can be secured at the system level and how proper configurations help prevent security threats.
